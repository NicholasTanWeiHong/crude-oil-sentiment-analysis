# Sentiment Analysis in Energy Markets

This project leverages on text data sourced from Twitter in addition to Natural Language Processing packages in R (E.g. qdap and tidytext) to perform basic Sentiment Analysis.

The objective will be to see if applying such methods to Twitter-sourced text data leads to any interesting insights. Future implementations might involve the integration of such findings with an algorithmic trading strategy to take positions based on market sentiment.
